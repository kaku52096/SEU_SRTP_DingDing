Changelog

2.1.3
- Switched to new head animation method HillHybrid. The old method SmoothDamp is still available if you want.
- Added new parameters Head Tilt and Neck Tilt in case you want to "roll" the head around the forward axis.
- Replaced parameter Nervousness with parameters Saccade Speed, Microsaccades per Minute and Macrosaccades per Minute.

2.1.2
- Made blinking more realistic with data from the paper "High-speed camera characterization of voluntary eye blinking kinematics"
- Added parameters IdleTargetHorizAngle, HeadJitterFrequency and headJitterAmount
- Implemented workaround for bug in SteamVR when using new Unity XR that reported wrong positions for left and right eye

2.1.1
- Added ability to fade REM in and out smoothly: 
	- mainWeight 
	- eyesWeight 
	- eyelidsWeight 
- Updated UMA preset

2.1.0
When updating, please delete the old RealisticEyeMovement folder first.
- Presets now use json instead of a binary format.
- Added preset for DAZ Studio characters.
- Added support for multiple bones per eyelid.
- New parameter "Update Mode" which has these options:
	- LateUpdate (default, as before)
	- FixedUpdate (if your animator is set to Animate Physics)
	- External (replaces the setting "areUpdatesControlledExternally")
- New parameter "Head Control" which has these options:
	- AnimatorIK (default, uses Mecanim's OnAnimatorIK)
	- Transform (custom head orientation for explicitly set head bone/object)
	- FinalIK (if your character uses LookAtIK, set this option)
	- Head Target (keeps updating the position of an object that you can use as target for Animation Rigging or other systems that orient that head towards a target)
	- None
- Deprecated support for Morph 3D (MCS) characters, because MCS itself has been discontinued.
- Replaced Head Speed Modifier by two parameters: head speed when changing to new target and head speed for tracking target.

1.9.8
Added slider for blinking speed
Minor internal improvements

1.9.7
Improved head dynamics
Added preset for MCS (Morph3D) males
Fixed issue with Unity 2017.1 predefines

1.9.6
Added option to call Update functions externally, for complex setups using FinalIK.
Improved eye blinking animation
Added support for MCS (Morph3D) characters
Improved looking when character walks

1.9.5
Added preset for MakeHuman 1.1 default rig
Fixed exporting preset when no blendshapes are used
Fixed issue when using both FinalIK's LookAt and FullBodyBiped components
Added OnStartLookingAtPlayer and OnStopLookingAtPlayer events

1.9.4
Support for head bone assignment for rigs that don't use Humanoid Mecanim or Final-IK
Fixed Webplayer
Fixed issue with Final-IK when using long spine chains in LookAtIK

1.9.3
Improved the head movement smoothing.
Fixed setup when using non-Mecanim rig with Final-IK
Added checks for eyelid bone assignment

1.9.2
Fixed error messages when timescale is set to 0.

1.9.1
Fixed slow blinking for blendshapes (blinking when eyes sweep more than 25 degrees)
Fixed changing look target when nervousness is set to higher value.
Added support for Final IK.
Added setting „Keep Target Even When Lost“
Split „Max Eye Horiz Angle“ into two angles, one towards the nose and one away from it.
Added support for 3rd person perspective games.
Blendshapes configurations are now saved by blendshape name, not blendshape index, so you don't have to reconfigure when you modify the number of blendshapes in the 3D modelling software.

1.9
You can now export and import presets. There are premade presets for Mixamo, Autodesk Character Generator, MakeHuman, and UMA.

1.8
For eyelid control with bones, the position of the bones is now saved as well (before only the rotation was saved). This makes it easier to set up rigs like those from Autodesk Character Generator.
New demo scene: you can switch between a character made with MakeHuman, Autodesk Character Generator, and Mixamo.
Head speed slider: lets you adjust the head turning speed.
Head latency (how much later the head starts turning than the eyes when looking at a new target) is now exposed in the API.
Fixed bug in look duration when calling LookAtPoiDirectly.
Fixed bug with eyeWiden slider.

1.7
